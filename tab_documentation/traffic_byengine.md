Traffic from external search engines, broken down
=======

A key metric in understanding the role external search engines play in Wikipedia's readership and content discovery processes is a very direct one - how many pageviews we get from them. This can be discovered very simply by looking at our request logs.

This dashboard simply breaks down the [http://discovery.wmflabs.org/external/#traffic_summary](summary data) to investigate how much traffic is coming from each search engine, individually. As you can see, Google dominates, which is why we've included the option of log-scaling
the traffic.
